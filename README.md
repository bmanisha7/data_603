### Fraud Prediction – Credit Card Transactions
• The theft in which someone else uses your credit card to make an unauthorized purchase is credit card fraud.
• There is a rapid increase in credit card frauds with the increase in E-payment systems.
• Out of 22 percent of total card volume in the United States, 36 percent was accounted as card fraud in 2021.
• credit card fraud increased by 44.6% from 271,927 in 2019 to 393,207 in 2020.
• According to Nilson’s research’s annual report, Global Card frauds might cost approximately $408.50 billion over the next decade.
